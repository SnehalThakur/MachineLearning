**Salary Estimator using K- Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**

**Introduction**
Most of companies problems are resignation’s of salaries, one of the major cause of resignations that they are not comfort on the place that they are working in, either the team they are working with, or the employees that they are having there offices in the same department, an idea comes in mind why not classifying people using KNN, so we can get the best place to work for our salaries, How is that ? in this article I will clarify how this classification is working.

We’ll see how can we use K Nearest Neighbor Algorithm to help us in this labour-intensive task.

**Here’s a general overview of what we will do:**

Getting a data set about relationships between people with different characteristics .
Calculating distances between 2 salaries depending on a table of distances that is generated from the training data set.
Use the classifier to classify a new salary into the right department.
The data
First of all, we’re going to need a data set. For that I have suggested to get it from relationships between people with different characteristics ,this data can be extracted from anywhere , social media ,court cases etc ..— this data set is a collection of data like ('age', 'education.num', 'capital.gain', 'hours.per.week', 'income').

**The sum of distances will be used instead of Euclidean distance in the KNN.**
