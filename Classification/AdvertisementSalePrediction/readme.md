**Advertisement Sale Prediction**

Forecasting sales is a difficult problem for every type of business, but it helps determine where a business should spend more on advertising and where it should cut spending. This project is about Advertisement Sales Prediction with Machine Learning using Python.

**What is Sales Prediction?**
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a productâ€™s sales are primarily dependent on how much you spend on advertising it, as the more people your product reaches, the more sales will increase as long as the quality of your product is good. Now in the section below, I will take you through a machine learning project on sales prediction using Python.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product.
